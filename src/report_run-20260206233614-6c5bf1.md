**Query:** What are the effects of metformin on diabetes?

**Answer:**
Based on the provided context, metformin, when used in combination with insulin, can help improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the study mentioned in context [1], patients treated with insulin and metformin (IC group) saw an improvement in their HbA1c levels from 8.3% to 7.6%. This group also experienced less weight gain and reported fewer hypoglycemic events compared to the group treated with insulin monotherapy (IM group). 

However, the context does not provide specific information on the effects of metformin alone on diabetes. Further research or context would be needed to provide a more comprehensive answer.
