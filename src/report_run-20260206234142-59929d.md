**What are the effects of metformin on diabetes?**

---

## Answer
Based on the provided context, metformin, when used in combination with insulin, has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a study, patients treated with insulin and metformin showed an improvement in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from 8.3% to 7.6% over a 12-month period [1]. 

Additionally, the combination of insulin and metformin resulted in less weight gain and fewer hypoglycemic events compared to insulin monotherapy. Patients in the insulin plus metformin group gained 1.3 kg on average, compared to 4.2 kg in the insulin monotherapy group. They also reported fewer hypoglycemic events (2.7 vs 4.3) [1]. 

However, the context does not provide information on the effects of metformin alone on diabetes, nor does it provide information on the long-term effects of metformin on diabetes-related complications. Further research would be needed to fully understand these aspects.
